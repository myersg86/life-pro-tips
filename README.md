# wise insights and enlightening snippets of truth'

Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike; each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others too little.

External circumstances **cannot** create lasting happiness.

We all make far more snap judgments than we realize, and often invent rational explanations for them later.

Life is too short to waste even a second complaining.

“Humankind has not woven the web of life.
We are but one thread within it.
Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.
All things are bound together.
All things connect.”
– Chief Seattle

... the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future.

- The highest virtue is to act without a sense of self
- The highest kindness is to give without a condition
- The highest justice is to see without a preference


In the sky, there is no distinction of east and west; people create distinctions out of their own minds and then believe them to be true.

All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think we become.
